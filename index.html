       <h2> Why is the rover called Perseverance?</h2> <p>A seventh-grade student, Alexander Mather, won a nationwide essay contest to name the rover. Perseverance is the latest in a long line of Red Planet rovers to be named by school-age children, from Sojourner in 1997 to the Spirit and Opportunity rovers, which landed on Mars in 2004, to Curiosity, which has been exploring Mars since 2012.
What is Perseverance doing on Mars? Perseverance is studying Mars' habitability, seeking signs of past microbial life, collecting and storing samples of selected rock and soil, and preparing for future human missions.</p>
<h2>How long is the Mars 2020 mission?</h2><p>At least one Mars year (about 687 Earth days).</p>
<h2>How is the Mars 2020 mission different from other missions?</h2><p> The Perseverance rover pioneers a drill that can collect core samples of the most promising rocks and soils, and set them aside in a "cache" on the surface of Mars. A future mission could potentially return these samples to Earth. Is there a helicopter going to Mars on Perseverance?
Yes. The Mars helicopter rides to Mars attached to the belly of the rover. The helicopter is a technology demonstration to test the first powered flight on Mars. Where did Perseverance land? The rover landed in Jezero Crater, an ancient river delta. Jezero has rocks and minerals that could only form in water.</p>
<h2>How did Perseverance land on Mars?</h2><p> Perseverance followed an entry, descent, and landing (EDL) process similar to that used by NASA's Curiosity Mars rover when it landed in 2012. You can see an illustration of the process on the EDL section.</p><h2> How can I follow Perseverance's journey on Mars?</h2>
<p>You can track the spacecraft's journey on Mars on the surface operations page.You can track the rover’s path in this location map.</p>
<h2>How long was the trip to Mars?</h2>
<p>The trip to Mars took about seven months. Perseverance landed on Thursday, Feb. 18, 2021. For details on Perseverance's historic journey, visit the cruise section.</p>
<h2>How did Perseverance aim toward the right landing spot?</h2>
<p>A few trajectory, or flight path, corrections were needed. During the cruise phase, engineers had various opportunities to adjust the flight path. During these trajectory correction maneuvers, or TCMs, engineers calculated the spacecraft’s location and commanded eight thrusters on the cruise stage to fire for the specific amount of time needed to tweak the path.

<h2>When did Perseverance launch?</h2>
<p>Perseverance launched on July 30, 2020 at 4:50 a.m. PDT / 7:50 a.m. EDT.</p>
